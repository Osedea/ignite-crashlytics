## Linting

We use [our eslint config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-osedea) to enforce our coding standards.

## Deploying

* Ensure you're logged into `npm` with `npm login` first.
* Ensure you're on the [collaborators list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignite-crashlytics/). (contact one of us if you're not)
* Pick the right semver. If it's a major bump, make sure you tell a friend first.
